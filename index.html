      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout school my favourite subject was Computer Science. I loved
        programming in my free time, even completing work experience at a UX web
        design company when I was 16. I continued this through university,
        taking a degree in it at the University of Nottingham. My time there
        gave me the opportinty to learn a variety of programming languages such
        as Python, Java and C#, and explore new fields like AI and Android
        Development. My favourite part of my studies there, however, was always
        participating in group projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since university, I've been working as a software developer at Ceox
        Services, developing business applications for public sector clients. I
        mainly use JavaScript, but I've also had the chance to learn new tools
        like Azure and NodeJS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work, I enjoy playing the guitar. I also love working on side
        projects (like this one) to learn new languages and frameworks. Take a
        look at my GitHub to find them!
